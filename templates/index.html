    <h2>E-Bikes</h2>
    <p style="color: white">  With e-dublinbikes, you can enjoy an effortless and smooth ride with an electric motor that assists you as you pedal. This feature is particularly beneficial if you're cycling uphill or covering long distances, as it reduces the physical effort required, making it more accessible and enjoyable.

Once you've signed up for the e-dublinbikes option, we'll organise the delivery of a personal battery to your address. The battery comes with a charger and is easy to install on your bike. You can use this battery with any of the available e-dublinbikes at our docking stations across the city.

It's important to note that the e-dublinbikes option is independent of your annual subscription, meaning it's a separate subscription that you can add to your existing plan. The e-dublinbikes subscription will renew independently of your annual subscription until you return the battery.</p>

                <div class="desc"> <b><u>Transport for Ireland</u></b>
  <p>Transport Minister Eamon Ryan has announced a bold move to prioritize the design of infrastructure for walking and cycling. In order to achieve this goal, a high standard of active travel infrastructure will be made a requirement of all transport funding. The design manuals and guidance that the Minister has referred to have been in place for over a decade but largely ignored or selectively used to defend rubbish designs.

“The National Transport Authority is tasked with handing out most of the walking cycling funding, it does not make sense to allow its own BusConnects team to have such scant regard for walking and cycling design - they said.</p>

 <div class="desc"> <b><u>Clontarf Cycle Route Path</u></b>
  <p>Today marks the opening of a new segment of the Clontarf to City Centre cycle path, which spans approximately 600 meters. This new section connects the junction with the Malahide road to just before the River Tolka at the Annesley Bridge.

Although this new segment is open to cyclists, they will still need to navigate through a shared space with buses, taxis, and other motorists as the project's work area is still ongoing. However, this marks the beginning of a phased opening of the entire route as sections are completed.</p>

 <div class="desc"> <b><u> Sandyford Businesss District </u></b>
     <p>A brand new walking and cycling link has just been opened by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). This link spans a total length of 114 meters and will connect the Drummartin Link Road to Bracken Road, bypassing the often-congested Blackthorn Drive junction near the Beacon Hospital.

The new access route, partially located within the TII Sandyford Maintenance Depot, will not only provide a more direct route for people traveling by foot or bicycle but also reduce their travel times significantly. It will connect two areas on opposite sides of the M50 - the bustling Sandyford Business District and the serene Sandyford Village - and make it much easier for commuters to navigate between the two locations.</p>
